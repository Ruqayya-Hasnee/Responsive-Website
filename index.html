            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking in distinguishing education
                from indoctrination..</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learning theories try to explain how learning happens. Influential
                theories are behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. Behaviorism understands learning as a change
                in behavior in response to environmental stimuli. This happens by presenting the learner with a
                stimulus, associating this stimulus with the desired response, and solidifying this stimulus-response
                pair. Cognitivism sees learning as a change in cognitive structures and focuses on the mental processes
                involved in storing, retrieving, and processing information. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A central topic in education studies concerns questions like why people
                should be educated and what goals should guide this process. Many aims of education have been suggested.
                On a basic level, education is about the acquisition of knowledge and skills but may also include
                personal development and fostering of character traits.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Educational ideologies are systems of basic philosophical assumptions and principles. They cover various
                additional issues besides the aims of education, like what topics are learned and how the learning
                activity is structured. Other topics include the role of the teacher and how the results are to be
                assessed. They also include claims on how to structure the institutional framework and policies.
